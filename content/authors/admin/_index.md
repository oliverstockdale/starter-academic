I am an Air Quality Consultant at [Katestone Environmental](https://katestone.global). My 
role involves understanding how clients' operations impact air quality by modelling their 
activities. In addition to understand clients' impact to the local environemnt, I am also 
interested in understanding how companies' greenhouse gas emissions affect the wider climate 
and developing strategies to reduce their footprint. 

I was a graduate research assistant in the [Many-Body Quantum 
Dynamics](https://mbqd.de) group at the 
Kirchhoff-Institut für Physik, Universität Heidelberg, Germany. Under the supervision of 
Priv.-Doz. Dr. Martin Gärttner, I sought to better understand the entanglement of quantum 
fields 
and improve upon their detection techniques. 
The theoretical research I carried out was in close collaboration with experiments in the 
[Synthetic Quantum Systems](https://synqs.org) group.

I previously studied the dynamics of superfluid vortices at the [ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy 
Electronics](https://www.fleet.org.au), University of Queensland, Australia with [Dr. Matthew 
Reeves](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/16962) and [Prof. Matthew 
Davis](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1134). We frequently collaborated with experimental teams using 
[ultracold atomic gases](https://bec.equs.org) and [superfluid helium-4](https://qo.lab.uq.edu.au).

My publications can be viewed on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=QIGtBiAAAAAJ&hl=en).

I was also part of the student contributor network for the maganzine [*Physics 
World*](https://physicsworld.com). I wrote about recent research updates in the field of 
quantum science and techology. My articles can be found [here](https://physicsworld.com/author/oliver-stockdale/).
