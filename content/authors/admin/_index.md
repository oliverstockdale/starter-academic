Oliver is a PhD student in the [Synthetic Quantum Systems](http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/synqs/) group at the Kirchhoff-Institut für Physik, Universität Heidelberg, Germany. Under the supervision of [Priv. Doz. Dr. Martin Gärttner, ](http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/user/marting/)he seeks to better understand the entanglement dynamics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. He primarily uses theoretical techniques such as entropic uncertainty relations. His theoretical work is in close collaboration with the experimental team led by [Prof. Dr. Markus Oberthaler.](http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/matterwave/)

Oliver previously studied the dynamics of superfluid vortices at the [ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics](https://www.fleet.org), University of Queensland under the supervision of [Dr. Matthew Reeves](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/16962) and [Prof. Matthew Davis](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1134). His research employed both theoretical and numerical methods to better understand both the collective dynamics of many vortices and the dynamics at the single-vortex level. Oliver frequently collaborated with experimental teams using [ultracold atomic gases](https://bec.equs.org) and [superfluid helium-4](http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/QOlab/people.html).
