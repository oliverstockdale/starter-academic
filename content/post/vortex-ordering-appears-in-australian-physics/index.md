Along with [Matt Reeves](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/16962) and [Matt Davis](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1134), I have written a summary article about our collective work on vortices in two-dimensional superfluids over the past few years. It has been published by the Australian Institute of Physics in their quarterly magazine *[Australian Physics](https://aip.org.au/australian-physics/)*.

We discuss various results such as those which recently confirmed Lars Onsager's theory on vortex ordering (found [here](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6447/1264.abstract)) as well as results which describe how superfluids dissipate energy via vortices (found [here](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033138)).

Currently, only members of the Australian Institute of Physics can read the article. However, after one year the publication becomes open access and anyone can access it!

I look forward to people reading it and, as always, welcome comments and feedback!
