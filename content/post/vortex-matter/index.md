summary: Our latest work on vortex matter in two-dimensional superfluid systems
  has just been published in Physical Review X! We study and realise the high-energy 
  phases of single-sign vortices, previously undetected in experimental systems.

Our new paper, *[Turbulent Relaxation to Equilibrium in a Two-Dimensional Quantum Vortex 
Gas](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.12.011031)*, has recently been published in Physical Review X!

In this paper, we study the high-energy phases of vortex matter in a superfluid quasi-2D Bose-Einstein condensate. These 
phases have eluded experimental detection before due to the requirements of very low dissipation and loss in experiments.

We show the emergence of off-axis equilibrium phases from highly nonequilibrium initial conditions, as well as 
thermalisation to equilibrium states within experimental timescales.

The experimental results we present are in close agreement with our theoretical and numerical calculations within mean field theory.

Our results offer insight into the long-debated vortex mass and maximum entropy theories, as well as establishing the 
validity of the point-vortex approximation for real superfluid systems.

Enjoy reading!
