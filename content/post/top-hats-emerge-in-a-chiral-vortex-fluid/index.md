Our [latest paper](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033138) was recently published in *Physical Review Research.* We studied the collective dynamics of many vortices in a two-dimensioanl superfluid to learn more about their chaotic behaviour.

We demonstrate that any cluster of same-sign vortices expands to form a 'Rankine vortex', which then expands self-similarly in time. 

We use a relatively new theory that describes collections of vortices as a *fluid*, i.e., we solve the hydrodynamics of *vortex fluids.* In addition to the analytical result, we provide numerical and experimental evidence to support our findings.

Check out the summary I wrote that appeared in [phys.org.](https://phys.org/news/2020-09-vortex-hats-emerge-superfluids.html)

A very similar article can be found in [Scimex](https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/vortex-top-hats-emerge-in-superfluids), where we better show the 'top-hat' nature.

Comments are very welcome, and hopefully we can build our knowledge upon this work!
