In collaboration with the [Queensland Quantum Optics Lab](http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/QOlab/index.html) and [Dr. Ashton Bradley](https://www.otago.ac.nz/physics/staff/AshtonBradley.html) from the University of Otago, the FLEET team at UQ have helped demonstrate the first observation of coherent vortex dynamics in a thin film of strongly interacting superfluid. 

The experiment leverages the interaction between light and matter, known as optomechanics, to track the motion of the vortices in real time. We were able to gain information about the cluster of vortices such as their spacial distribution, as well as their energy, through numerically modelling their behaviour and comparing the results with experimental observations.

Our results were published in the journal [Science.](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6472/1480)
