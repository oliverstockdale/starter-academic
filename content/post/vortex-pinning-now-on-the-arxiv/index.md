Our [latest work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04712) studying the dynamical behaviour of vortices becoming pinned in a superfluid has recently appeared on the arXiv!

In this preprint, we consider a simple scattering experiment: a vortex is fired at an obstacle in a 2D superfluid moving with a constant velocity. The obstacle is simply a circular defect within which the superfluid density is depleted. We study the mechanisms that lead to the vortex becoming pinned (i.e., trapped on the defect) and create a phase diagram of vortex pinning.

In our work, we consider a *zero-temperature* superfluid. We ignore thermal effects (such as friction) as superfluid experiments are moving into the regime where these phenomena can be ignore (see, e.g., our previous paper about [coherent vortex dynamics in superfluid helium](https://oliver-stockdale.com/post/observation-of-coherent-vortex-dynamics-in-a-thin-film-of-strongly-interacting-superfluid/)).

To aid in our understanding of how the vortex behaves, we develop an analytical hydrodynamic approximation of the system which provides insight into the vortex trajectories around the pin, the vortex fixed point, and the *unpinning* behaviour. 

We anticipate that the results in this preprint will help work towards using superfluids to develop quantum technologies. Our work gains an understanding of how to control and manipulate vortices with pinning sites to potentially mitigate the deleterious effects they create.

Enjoy reading, and any comments are of course welcome!
