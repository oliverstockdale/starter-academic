title: Entanglement detection via entropies in spinor Bose gases
abstract: Simultaneous measurements of two non-commuting spin observables allows for direct access to a 
quasi-probability distribution and its associated entropy. In the Gaussian regime, this corresponds to the 
Husimi Q-distribution and Wehrl entropy, respectively. We analytically and numerically model the system and 
measure a non-zero Wehrl mutual informationâ€”a perfect entanglement witness for pure states. We present a 
preliminary analysis of experimental data that shows for certain times non-zero Wehrl mutual information is 
observed.
