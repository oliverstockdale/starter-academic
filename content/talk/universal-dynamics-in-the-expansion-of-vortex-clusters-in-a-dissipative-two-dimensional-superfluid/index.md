title: "Universal dynamics in the expansion of vortex clusters in a dissipative
  two-dimensional superfluid "
abstract: A large ensemble of quantum vortices in a superfluid may itself be
  treated as a novel kind of fluid that exhibits anomalous hydrodynamics. In
  this talk, Iâ€™ll consider the dynamics of vortex clusters under thermal
  friction and present an analytic solution that uncovers a new universality
  class in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of dissipative superfluids. The
  long-time dynamics of the vorticity distribution is universal in the form of
  an expanding Rankine vortex (i.e., top-hat distribution) independent of
  initial conditions. This highlights a fundamentally different decay process to
  classical fluids, where the Rankine vortex is forbidden by viscous diffusion.
  Experimental results of expanding vortex clusters in a quasi-two-dimensional
  Bose-Einstein condensate are in excellent agreement with the vortex fluid
  theory predictions. Our theoretical, numerical, and experimental results
  establish the validity of the vortex fluid theory for superfluid systems.
