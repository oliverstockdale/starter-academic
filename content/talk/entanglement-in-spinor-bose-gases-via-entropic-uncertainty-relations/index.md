title: Entanglement in spinor Bose gases via entropic uncertainty relations
abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to witness entanglement in spinor
  Bose gases using entropic uncertainty relations. Simultaneous measurements of
  two non- commuting spin observables (here $S^x$ and $Q^{yz}$) allows for
  direct access to a quasi- probability distribution [Fig. 1(b)] and its
  associated entropy. In the Gaussian regime this corresponds to the Husimi
  distribution and Wehrl entropy, respectively. We simulate the system via the
  truncated Wigner approximation and perform a covariance analysis of the
  distribution [Fig. 1(c)]. We observe a non-zero Wehrl mutual information $I_W$
  [Fig. 1(d)], where $I_W > 0$ is a perfect entanglement witness as it measures
  only the quantum correlations (given the initial state has zero classical
  correlations). Future work will extend the analysis to the non- Gaussian
  regime to understand the long-time behaviour of entanglement.
