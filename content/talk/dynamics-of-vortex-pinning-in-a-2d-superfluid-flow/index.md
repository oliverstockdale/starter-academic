title: " Dynamics of vortex pinning in a 2D superfluid flow"
abstract: An understanding of the turbulent behaviour of superfluid flow is
  important for their future development for devices such as exciton
  transistors. Therefore, an understanding of the dynamics of vortices and their
  pinning behaviour is essential. While vortex pinning is reasonably
  well-understood in superconductors, an understanding of the dynamics of vortex
  pinning is not as well developed in superfluids [1, 2]. Here we simulate the
  scattering of a quantised vortex off a pinning obstacle in a two-dimensional
  atomic superfluid using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We provide a framework
  for interpreting the numerical simulations by mapping the mean-field
  description of the superfluid to classical electrostatics. We show that our
  simulations are consistent with analytical solutions of an analogue system of
  a free charge interacting with a dielectric medium in regimes when the flow
  velocity is small (see Fig. 1). By building a phase portrait of vortex pinning
  we elucidate the physical mechanisms that lead to vortex pinning, as well as
  calculating the superfluid velocity required to unpin a vortex. We find that
  larger pinning sites are not always the most efficient way to pin a vortex. We
  will also present results for vortex pinning in driven-dissipative polariton
  superfluid flows.
