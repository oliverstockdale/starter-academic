title: Entropy, uncertainty, quantum fields and entanglement
abstract: In this presentation, I summarise the progress of our ISOQUANT project. I review the original goals of the project and then present the 
  current state of the research. I discuss our experimental platform, new entropic entanglement witnesses, and the very first entropic uncertainty 
  relations for a quantum field theory.
